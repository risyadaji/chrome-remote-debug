With this version number a new image can be released

    make TAG=60.0.3112.101 builddocker push

    docker exec -it chrome tail -f /var/log/chrome.log

# Important notes

- The shm-size must be set to a higher value than the default of 64mb because chrome uses this for inter process communications.
- No password is set for VNC.
- The chrome sandbox is disabled because the chrome sandbox interferes with the Docker sandbox
